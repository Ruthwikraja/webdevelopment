1 . This implies that dynamic typed languages do not require the explicit declaration of the variables before they're used.

2 . false

3 . List
    List is a container to contain different types of objects and is used to iterate objects.

    Example
    list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
    
    Tuples
    Tuple is also similar to list but contains immutable objects. Tuple processing is faster than List.
    Example
    tuples = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')

4 . If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.

5 . we can use double or single cote in this way -->
    """statment""" or '''statement'''

6 . The len() function returns the number of items in an object.
    When the object is a string, the len() function returns the number of characters in the string.

7 . Text Type:	str
    Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
    Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
    Mapping Type:	dict
    Set Types:	set, frozenset
    Boolean Type:	bool
    Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview
    this are the built in data types in python
    
8 . True

9 . Control statements in python are used to control the order of execution of the program based on the values and logic.

10 . Notice that there is no token that denotes the end of the block. Rather, the end of the block is indicated by a line that is indented 
     less 
     than the lines of the block itself. Note: In the Python documentation, a group of statements defined by indentation is often referred to as a
     suite.
     
11 . Class is not core data type in python.

12 . In python we can use float() function to convert string to float.

13 . A = [1, 23, ‘hello’, 1] this is string data type in python.

14 .  Ther will be no output of this code ( 5 // 2) terminal show this error --"unexpected indent"

3 . Class is not core datatype in python.

4 . input() fuction will used to take user input in python 3 .

5 . Refer group no 1 que no 7 answer.

6 . type() This function is used for geting the object data type in which format
    example.
    x = 5
    print(type(x))

7 . There are two types of variables: global variables and local variables. The scope of global variables is the entire program whereas the 
    scope  of local variable is limited to the function where it is defined

8 .  Python uses indentation to define blocks of code. Indentations are simply spaces or tabs used as an indicator that is part of the
     indent 
     code child.

9 . In Python, sequence is the generic term for an ordered set. There are several types of sequences in Python, the following three are the 
    most important. Lists are the most versatile sequence type. ... Strings are a special type of sequence that can only store characters, and they have a special notation.

10 . This are the advantages of pythone:-
      Easy to Read, Learn and Write. Python is a high-level programming language that has English-like syntax. ...
      Improved Productivity. 
      Python is a very productive language.
      Interpreted Language. 
      Dynamically Typed. ...
      Free and Open-Source. 
      Vast Libraries Support.
      Portability. 
      Slow Speed.

11 . Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable. Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections 
     of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

12 . (#)This charector are used to make single line comment 
       Exmaple

13 . If you have only one statement to execute, you can put it on the same line as the if statement.
     Example
     if a > b: print("a is greater than b")

14 . In systems engineering, information systems and software engineering, the systems development life cycle, also referred to as the  
     application development life-cycle, is a process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying an information system

1 . Refer the Group no 1 questio no 3 for ans.

2 . Python is easy to learn, Python is good for starting out because the syntax of Python is very simple and understandable, We can create 
    GUI and CGI in a few lines of code. 

3 . If statements, If-else statements, Elif statements nensted if and if-else statements, elif ladder

4 . Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable, A set is a collection which is both unordered and unindexed. Sets are 
    written with curly brackets.

6 . Python defines type conversion functions to directly convert one data type to another which is useful in day to day and competitive 
    programming. This article is aimed at providing information about certain conversion functions.

7 . yes, In the case of Python, indentation is not for styling purpose. It is rather a requirement for your code to get compiled and 
    executed. Thus it is mandatory.

8 . Repated 

9 . if statement is the most simple decision making statement. It is used to decide whether a certain statement or block of statements will 
    be executed or not i.e if a certain condition is true then a block of statement is executed otherwise not. Whenever there is only a 
    single statement to be executed inside the if block then shorthand if can be used. The statement can be put on the same line as the if s
    tatement.

10 .Using Python range() method, List Comprehension, Using Python enumerate() method, By using a for Loop ,By using a while Loop, Using 
    Python NumPy module, Using lambda function 

11 . list = [2, 3] tuple = (2, 3) dict = {"name" : "Meerhasan"} set = {"Meerhasan", "Shaikh"}

13 . string is text which is inside of "" or '' . int is a primitive variable to store integer numbers. String is an object with methods 
     that allow text manipulation.

14 . tuple in Python is similar to a list. The difference between the two is that we cannot change the elements of a tuple once it is 
     assigned whereas we can change the elements of a list.

15 . Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space 
     in memory. types are the following - Python Integers and Floats · 2. Strings · 3. Boolean and None · 4. Lists · 5. Dictionaries · 6. Top 4 Other Data Types.

1 . Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for 
    readability only, the indentation in Python is very important. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

3 . An interpreted language is a programming language whose implementations execute instructions directly and freely, without previously 
    compiling a program into machine-language instructions. 2. In this language, once the program is compiled it is expressed in the 
    instructions of the target machine.

4 . In a compiled language, the target machine directly translates the program. In an interpreted language, the source code is not directly 
    translated by the target machine. Instead, a different program, aka the interpreter, reads and executes the code
