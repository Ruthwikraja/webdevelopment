1.1 What is a dynamically typed Language?
                    Dynamic typed programming language in which variables must necessarily be defined before they are used.
                                        E.g : python.
        
1.2 Can tuple be used as a dictionary key in python? (True or False)
                      True :
                       --if all the elements are mutable.
                  
1.3 Difference b/w list and tuple?
                            1.list is mutable            ,   tuple is immutable
                            2. list takes elemnt in []   ,   tuple takes element in () 
 
 1.4 What is type casting in Python?
                             Type casting or type conversation  is a method of changing an entity from one data type to another data type.
                             
                             if you declare the variable as a string and you want to convert it into float so you can use float(),it is called type casting.

                                    Here , x and y are local variables..
                  Global variables :
                                  Global variables can used anywhere in the code.
                                   E.g :  z =10
                                          def function():
                                              global z
                                              print(z)
                                          function()
                                          print(z)
                                   Here , z is the global variable..

                 boolen: True or Flase keyword
                 list[]:List is an ordered sequence of items. It is one of the most used datatype in Python and is very flexible. 
                         All the items in a list do not need to be of the same type.
                 tuple():Tuple is an ordered sequence of items same as a list. 
                          The only difference is that tuples are immutable.

                 dict{}: Dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs.
                 set{}: A Set is an unordered collection data type that is iterable, mutable and has no duplicate elements. 

3.13  how identify datatypes is string or integer in python?
                if the input in " " so it is in string 
                  or u can find using type()

3.14  Explain in detail tuple ?with example 
               Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable
               t1 = (1, "Hello", 3.4)

3.15  what are types of variable in python? Explain it.
               Variable types in the program is entirely dependent on the type of the data that are to be used for declaring.
