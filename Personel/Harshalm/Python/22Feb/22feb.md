1.1 What is a dynamically typed Language?
Ans :- Dynamic typed programming languages are those languages in which variables must  necessarily be defined before they are used. This implies that dyanamic typed languages do not require the explicit declaration of the variables before they're used.

1.2 Can tuple be used as a dictionary key in python? (True or False)
Ans :- False. 
  A tuple can be used as a key so long as all of its elements are immutable.

1.3 Difference b/w list and tuple?
Ans :- We can conclude that although both lists and tuples are data structures in Python, there are remarkable differences between the two, with the main difference being that lists are mutable while tuples are immutable. A list has a variable size while a tuple has a fixed size.

1.4 What is type casting in Python??
Ans :- Type casting is a method used for changing the variables/ values declared in a certain data type into a different data type in order to match for the operation required to be performed by the code snippet. In python, this feature can be accomplished by using the constructor functions like int(), string(), float(), etc.

1.5 What is the difference between list and tuples in Python?
Ans :- The main difference between lists and tuples is the fact that lists are mutable whereas tuples are immutable. A mutable data type means that a python object of this type can be modified.

1.6 How to comment multiple lines in python?
Ans :- Unlike other programming languages Python doesn't support multi-line comment blocks out of the box. The recommended way to comment out multiple lines of code in Python is to use consecutive # single-line comments.

1.7 What does len() do?
Ans :- The len() function returns the number of items in an object. When the object is a string, the len() function returns the number of characters in the string.

1.8 What are the built-in types of python?
Ans :- Python uses five numeric types: Booleans, integers, long integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers. Except for Booleans, all numeric objects are signed.

1.9 The condition x <= y <= z is allowed in Python?(True or False)
Ans :- There is usually only one correct solution to a problem involving decision structures. The condition x <= y <= z is allowed in Python. Input validation means prompting a user when input is required.

1.10 What Control statement does in Python Program?
Ans :-Control statements in python are used to control the order of execution of the program based on the values and logic.

1.11 What signifies the end of a statement block or suite in Python?
Ans:- Notice that there is no token that denotes the end of the block. Rather, the end of the block is indicated by a line that is indented less than the lines of the block itself. Note: In the Python documentation, a group of statements defined by indentation is often referred to as a suite.

1.12 Which data type is not a core data type in python?
Ans :-Class is a user defined data type.  Given a function that does not return any value, What value is thrown by default when executed in shell.

1.13 Which function converts a string to a float in python?
Ans :-  We can convert a string to float in Python using float() function. It's a built-in function to convert an object to floating point number.

1.14 What data type is this? A = [1, 23, ‘hello’, 1]
Ans :- List

1.15 What is the output of the following code? 5 // 2
Ans :- 2

3.10  How to iterate list?
Ans:- List  is equivalent to arrays in other languages, with the extra benefit of being dynamic in size.

3.11  How to access list, tuple, dictionary, set?
Ans :- Lists: -are just like dynamic sized arrays, declared in other languages (vector in C++ and ArrayList in Java). Lists need not be homogeneous always which makes it a most powerful tool in Python.
Tuple: A Tuple is a collection of Python objects separated by commas. In someways a tuple is similar to a list in terms of indexing, nested objects and repetition but a tuple is immutable unlike lists that are mutable.
Set: A Set is an unordered collection data type that is iterable, mutable and has no duplicate elements. Python’s set class represents the mathematical notion of a set.
Dictionary: in Python is an unordered collection of data values, used to store data values like a map, which unlike other Data Types that hold only single value as an element, Dictionary holds key:value pair. Key value is provided in the dictionary to make it more optimized.
List, Tuple, Set, and Dictionary are the data structures in python that are used to store and organize the data in an efficient manner.

3.12  Explain Datatypes of python?
Ans :- Data types are the classification or categorization of data items. It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data. Since everything is an object in Python programming, data types are actually classes and variables are instance (object) of these classes.

3.13  how identify datatypes is string or integer in python?
Ans :- the data type of variable in Python, use type() method. Python type() is an inbuilt method that returns the class type of the argument(object) passed as a parameter. You place the variable inside of a type() function, and Python returns the data type.

3.14  Explain in detail tuple ?with example?
Ans:- Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable. Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage. A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.

3.15   what are types of variable in python? Explain it.
Ans:- A few basic variable types are used in the code, such as the Integer variable type for numerical values, Floating point variables for the decimal numeric variables, string variable types for character representation, Boolean variable type for true/ false and 0/ 1 values, and the list variable type for a list

4.2 What are diff datatypes in python?
Ans :- 
 
4.3 What is meant by interpreted language?
Ans:- An interpreted language is a programming language whose implementations execute instructions directly and freely, without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions.

4.4 What is diff between Compiled and interpreted language?
Ans :-In a compiled language, the target machine directly translates the program. In an interpreted language, the source code is not directly translated by the target machine. Instead, a different program, aka the interpreter, reads and executes the code.

4.5 Which datatype is a mutable datatype?
Ans:- A mutable object can be changed after it is created, and an immutable object can't. Objects of built-in types like (int, float, bool, str, tuple, unicode) are immutable. Objects of built-in types like (list, set, dict) are mutable. Custom classes are generally mutable.
