1.1 What is a dynamically typed Language?
	Python is both a strongly typed and dynamically typed language.strong typing means that variable do not have a type that the type matters when performing operations on a variable. Dynamic typing means that the type of the variable is determined only during runtime.

1.2 Can tuple be used as a dictionary key in python? (True or False)
	False . Because a tuple can be used as a key so long as all of its elements are mutables.

1.3 Difference b/w list and tuple?
	Lists are mutable objects which means you can modify a list object after it has been created. 
	Tuples, on the other hand, are immutable objects which means you can't modify a tuple object after it's been created
.
1.4 What is type casting in Python??
	Type casting is a method used for changing the variables/ values declared in a certain data type into a different data type in order to match for the operation required to be performed by the code snippet.

1.5 What is the difference between list and tuples in Python?
	Lists are mutable objects which means you can modify a list object after it has been created. 
	Tuples, on the other hand, are immutable objects which means you can't modify a tuple object after it's been created

1.6 How to comment multiple lines in python?
	Python doesn't support multi-line comment blocks out of the box.
    1. The recommended way to comment out multiple lines of code in Python is to use consecutive # single-line comments.

1.7 What does len() do?
	The len() function returns the number of items in an object. When the object is a string, the len() function returns the number of characters in the string.


1.8 What are the built-in types of python?
	Python uses five numeric types: Booleans, integers, long integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers. Except for Booleans, all numeric objects are signed.

1.9 The condition x <= y <= z is allowed in Python?(True or False)
	The condition x <= y <= z is allowed in Python. Input validation means prompting a user when input is required.

1.12 Which data type is not a core data type in python?
	Class is a user defined data type.Given a function that does not return any value, What value is thrown by default when executed in shell.

1.13 Which function converts a string to a float in python?
	We can convert a string to float in Python using float() function. It's a built-in function to convert an object to floating point number.
	
1.14 What data type is this? A = [1, 23, ‘hello’, 1]
	List
	
1.15 What is the output of the following code? 5 // 2
	2

2.7 what are local variables and global variables in python?
	There are two types of variables global variables and local variables. 
A global variable can be reached anywhere in the code, 
a local only in the scope. 
A global variable (x) can be reached and modified anywhere in the code,
local variable (z) exists only in block 3

2.8 What do we use to define a block of code in Python language?Which

3.1   What is the difference between list and tuples in Python?
	repeated
3.2   How python  is differ from other language?
	Python is an interpreted and dynamically typed language, whereas Java is a compiled and statically typed language. Python code doesn't need to be compiled before being run. Java code, on the other hand, needs to be compiled from code readable by humans to code readable by the machine.
3.3   Give types of if else  statement and explain it ?
	These are the statements which alter the control flow of execution in our program. We have different types of conditional statements like if, if-else, elif, nested if and nested if-else statements which control the execution of our program.
3.4.   what is a set?
	A set is a group or collection of objects or numbers, considered as an entity unto itself.
3.5    What are the key features of Python?
	repeated
3.6   What is type conversion in Python?
	Type Conversion is the conversion of object from one data type to another data type. Python avoids the loss of data in Implicit Type Conversion. Explicit Type Conversion is also called Type Casting.
3.7    Is indentation required in python?
	yes
3.8   What are the built-in type does python provides?
	Python uses five numeric types: Booleans, integers, long integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers. Except for Booleans, all numeric objects are signed. All numeric types are immutable.
3.9   what is diff between if and shorthand if ?
	If : if condition :
		statement
	shorthand if : condition if : statement
3.10  How to iterate list?
	There are the different ways to list to iterate in python.
3.11  How to access list, tuple, dictionary, set?
	we can create a series of numbers using range() function. through all tuple values; Dictionaries; Basic Dictionary operations: Modifying dictionary,As we know, the tuple is an immutable list type, which means it can not be modified. To access any value, we have to use the key, which is associated with value.

4.1 What is indentation in python?
		Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

4.2 What are diff datatypes in python?
  	Integers , sets, boolean, tuples , string
4.3 What is meant by interpreted language?
		An interpreted language is a programming language whose implementations execute instructions directly and freely.
4.4 What is diff between Compiled and interpreted language?
		In a compiled language, the target machine directly translates the program. In an interpreted language, the source code is not directly translated by the target machine. Instead, a different program, aka the interpreter, reads and executes the code.
