4.3 What is meant by interpreted language?
 ans - An interpreted language is a programming language whose implementations execute instructions directly and freely, without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions. 2. In this language, once the program is compiled it is expressed in the instructions of the target machine.
​
4.4 What is diff between Compiled and interpreted language?
 ans - Interpreted vs Compiled Programming Languages: What's the Difference? ... In a compiled language, the target machine directly translates the program.
