Today we seen different types of datatatypes in python. and also saw indentation and how to commenting.

Datatypes:

1)List: It is like array in other languages.
	syntax: [1, 'jeet', 7]
	so list is a collection of different types of datatypes.
	
2)Tuple:It is like list but we can't change values. so it is immutable
	syntax: (1,'jeet',7)

3)Dictionary:In that there is a key, value pair.
	      syntax: {1:'jeet', 2:'parekh'}

4)Set:It is like dictionary, but duplication is not allowed here.And also it is unordered.
      syntax: {1,2,3}
      
5)Boolean: In python there is 3 bool values: True, False, None

6)Also we done programs.
