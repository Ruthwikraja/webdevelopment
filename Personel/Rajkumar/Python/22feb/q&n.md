3.2   How python  is differ from other language?
Ans: Python is an interpreted and dynamically typed language, whereas Java is a compiled and statically typed language. Python code doesn't need to be compiled before being run. Java code, on the other hand, needs to be compiled from code readable by humans to code readable by the machine.
